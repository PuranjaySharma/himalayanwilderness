	<h2>About Himalayan Wilderness</h2>
	<p>Heaven is all around us. Its description in every holy book is the same, lush green gardens,
		free flowing springs and rivers, incorruptible water, snow clad milky mountains. Only 
		difference is that we call it nature. Nature can be the most loving and the most fierceful
		at the same time. It is the most embellished and the most abstract creation. In any which way,
		it is above beautiful and The Himalayas have it all. Travelling into them redefines life, changes
		our perspective towards it. With every breath of fresh air we breathe a new life and experience a new self.<br><br>
		Its is understandable that extensive  travelling is not feasible to all. So why not treat yourself with our refreshing 
		and exclusive photographs of the wild Himalayas. Undoubtedly mother nature is for all. So what makes our work exclusive?
		Behind our each photograph lies a story and immense hard work. Extensive travel, perfect timing, elaborate study of
		weather conditions and their impact on natural colours, professional detailing's, study of  miraculous landscape
		changes of places in different seasons and above all, a pure and keen intention to capture the best of nature in
		its supreme form and present it to you. Keep a refreshing frame of nature on your table top or on the wall as a
		reminder to be a part of that place sometime in life. Consider it as a souvenir from mother nature to yourself.
		Together, let's fall in love with mother nature.
